## Description

Exploring, designing, and sharing, Squirrel is a planning platform for users who love self-guided travel. Users could feel free to create, update and edit their
travel plans and a timeline will be automatically created right after their clicks. Within our Squirrel community, people share their travel plans. In addition, 
users can share their experience to external platforms, for instance, Twitter and Instagram. Squirrel cares about every member, all the plans they made and activity on the website are archived.
